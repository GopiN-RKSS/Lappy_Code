1. What is ReactJS?

   * React is a JavaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications.
   * It is an open-source, component-based, front-end library responsible only for the application’s view layer.
   * React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. 

2. Name some advantages of React?

	1. Easy creation of dynamic applications: It requires less coding and offers more functionality. 

	2. Improved performance: React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster. Virtual DOM compares the components’ previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were changed.

	3. Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. These components have their logic and controls, and they can be reused throughout the application, which in turn dramatically reduces the application’s development time.
	
	4. Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when designing a React app, developers often nest child components within parent components. Since the data flows in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know where a problem occurs in an application at the moment in question.
	
	5. It can be used for the development of both web and mobile apps: React is used for the development of web applications and React Native, derived from React itself, that is hugely popular and is used for creating beautiful mobile applications.
	
	6. Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be used to debug React applications. This makes the process of debugging React web applications faster and easier.

3. What is JSX?

  * JSX is a JavaScript Extension Syntax used in React to write HTML and JavaScript together.
  * browser does not understand the JSX because its not a valid JavaScript code.
  * create-react-app internally uses Babel for the JSX to JavaScript conversion.
  
4. Can web browsers read JSX directly?

	* Web browsers cannot read JSX directly. This is because they are built to only read regular JS objects and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object.
	
	* For a web browser to read a JSX file, the file needs to be transformed into a regular JavaScript object. For this, we use Babel

5. What is the difference b/w state and props?

	State: The state is a built-in React object that contains data or information about the component. A component’s state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.
	
	* State is used to store the data of the components that have to be rendered to the view.
	* State holds the data and can change over time.
	* State can only be used in class components.
	* Event handlers generally update state.
	
	Props : Props are short for properties. It is a React built-in object which stores the value of a tag’s attributes and works similar to the HTML attributes. It provides a way to pass data from one component to other components in the same way as arguments are passed in a function.
	
	* Props are used to pass data to the children components.
	* Props are immutable—once set, props can`t be changed.
	* Props can be used in both functional and class components.
	* The parent component sets props for the children components.
	
		

6. What are the disadvantages of Reactjs?

   * Poor Documentation.
   * View Part : ReactJS Covers only the UI Layers of the app and nothing else. So you still need to choose some other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development in the project.
   * The high pace of development : The high pace of development has an advantage and disadvantage both. In case of disadvantage, since the environment continually changes so fast, some of the developers not feeling comfortable to relearn the new ways of doing things regularly. It may be hard for them to adopt all these changes with all the continuous updates. They need to be always updated with their skills and learn new ways of doing things.
   
7. What is the difference between createElement and cloneElement?
 
	JSX elements will be transpiled to React.createElement() functions to create React elements which are going to be used for the object representation of UI. Whereas cloneElement is used to clone an element and pass it new props.

8. What is the difference between Element and Component?

	An Element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. Elements can contain other Elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.

	* The object representation of React Element would be as follows:
	
	const element = React.createElement('div', { id: 'login-btn' }, 'Login');
	
	* The above React.createElement() function returns an object:
	
	{
	  type: 'div',
	  props: {
		children: 'Login',
		id: 'login-btn'
	  }
	}
	
	
	* And finally it renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render():

	<div id="login-btn">Login</div>

	
	** Whereas a component can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a render() method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:

	const Button = ({ onLogin }) => (
	  <div id={'login-btn'} onClick={onLogin}>
		Login
	  </div>
	);
	
	* Then JSX gets transpiled to a React.createElement() function tree:

	const Button = ({ onLogin }) =>
	React.createElement('div', { id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin }, 'Login');
	
	
9. When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?

	If the component needs state or lifecycle methods then use class component otherwise use function component. However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component.
	
10. What are Pure Components?

	React.PureComponent is exactly the same as React.Component except that it handles the shouldComponentUpdate() method for you. When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. Component on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever shouldComponentUpdate is called.	
	
11. Why should we not update the state directly?

	If you try to update state directly then it won't re-render the component.

	//Wrong
	this.state.message = 'Hello world';
	Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

	//Correct
	this.setState({ message: 'Hello World' });
	
12. What is the virtual DOM?

	React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.
	
	
13. What is the difference between the ES6 and ES5 standards?


14. What is an event in React?

	An event is an action that a user or system may trigger, such as pressing a key, a mouse click, etc.
	React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase in HTML.
	With JSX, you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string in HTML.
	
	<Button onPress={lightItUp} />
	
15. What are synthetic events in React?

	Synthetic events combine the response of different browser's native events into one API, ensuring that the events are consistent across different browsers.
	The application is consistent regardless of the browser it is running in. Here, preventDefault is a synthetic event.
	
	Ex: event.preventDefault();
	
16. What is React Router?
	
	React Router is a routing library built on top of React, which is used to create routes in a React application. 
	
	
17. Why do we need to React Router?

	It maintains consistent structure and behavior and is used to develop single-page web applications. 
	Enables multiple views in a single application by defining multiple routes in the React application.
